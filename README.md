# Vulkan-Portability

This repository contains the spec description and header files for the Vulkan Portability extension.

The `src/sample.cpp` file contains sample code for probing Vulkan portability extension behaviour.
Code snippets from this file can be copied to applications that need to query the portability
behaviour of a Vulkan implementation that implements the Vulkan Portability extension.
